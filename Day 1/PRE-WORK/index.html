                        Personal Bio:
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        I am an incoming junior in CS and Econ at New York University, U.S.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        This is a relatively simple page without many sections or styles and I will improve on it 
                        in the next week.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am pretty new in this field as I was focusing on Economics mainly in the first two years of study,
                        but after taking a moment to rethink, I think computer science and software is the thing for 
                        me instead of economics. I love CS because it can output what's in my brain visually and more intuitively than writing or speaking.
                        It empowers more possibilities then ever. But I am a newcover, I may have a lot of insufficiencies and hope we can all learn and
                        improve this summer! I will work harder than before with all of you. Best luck to this program and I'm looking forward to meet all of you!
